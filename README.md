# particle_filter_cpp
Particle filter implementation inspired from https://github.com/mjl/particle_filter_demo and Udacity's Artificial
Intelligence for Robotics course. 

Implementation in C++ with OpenCV for graphics.

A robot is placed in a maze-world. The world has a number of beacons represented by red dots. At any time & location, 
the robot has access to a noisy measurement of the distance to the closest beacon. The particle filter is used to
estimate the robot's pose (x, y, heading).
